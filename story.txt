(EDITED)A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driver-less car, or robotic car (robo-car), is a car incorporating vehicular automation, that is, a ground vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. Self-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. Control methods based on artificial intelligence can then be used to learn all the gathered sensory information in order to control the vehicle and support various autonomous-driving tasks.
